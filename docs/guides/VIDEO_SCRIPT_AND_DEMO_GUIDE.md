### **[0:00-0:45] OPENING - THE CLIMATE CRISIS**

**Visuals:** News headlines, drought images, farmer distress
**Background music:** Serious, dramatic

**Script:**
```
[News Headlines Show]: "Maharashtra farmers lose ₹500 crore to drought"
                        "Climate change threatens 15 crore Indian farmers"
                        "Erratic monsoon destroys crops"

VOICEOVER (Hindi/English):
"हर साल, जलवायु परिवर्तन भारतीय किसानों को ₹1 लakh crore का नुकसान देता है।
(Every year, climate change costs Indian farmers ₹1 lakh crore)

सूखा, बाढ़, extreme heat - farmers don't know what's coming next.
(Drought, floods, extreme heat - farmers don't know what's coming next)

क्या अगर Artificial Intelligence किसानों को climate change से adapt करने में मदद कर सके?
(What if Artificial Intelligence could help farmers adapt to climate change?)

[Screen transitions to app logo]
We built exactly that."

### **[0:45-1:30] PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Visuals:** 3 farmer stories (actors/animated)

**Script:**
```
PROBLEM 1: Wrong Crop Selection
"Ramesh planted rice like every year.
But this time - 30% less rainfall.
Total crop failure. ₹2 lakh loss."

PROBLEM 2: No Climate Information
"Sita didn't know about drought-resistant varieties.
Could have saved her farm - but information never reached her."

PROBLEM 3: Water Waste
"Arjun used traditional irrigation.
Used 40% more water than needed.
Higher costs, lower profits, depleted groundwater."
